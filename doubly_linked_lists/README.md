## Introduction

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous node. This allows for traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

## Features

- **Traversal:** Supports traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.
- **Insertion and Deletion:** Allows insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Dynamically allocates memory for nodes, making efficient use of memory.
